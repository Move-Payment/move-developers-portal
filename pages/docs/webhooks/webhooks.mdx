Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about payment events. When a payment event occurs, MovePay will send an HTTP POST request to your webhook URL with the payment data.

To set up a webhook, follow these steps:

1. [Log in to the MovePay Merchant Panel](https://merchant.movepayment.eu).
2. From the dashboard, navigate to the **Other-API Settings** section.
3. Click on the **Webhooks** tab.
4. Click on the **Add webhook** button.
5. Enter the webhook URL and select the events you want to receive notifications for.
6. Click on the **Save** button to save your webhook configuration.

When a payment event occurs, MovePay will send a payload to your webhook URL in the following format:

```typescript
enum PaymentStatus {
  PENDING = "pending",
  PAID = "paid",
  REJECTED = "rejected",
  ERRORED = "errored",
  INIT = "initialized",
}

interface WebhookPayload {
  orderId: string; // Your order ID
  transactionId: string; // MovePay transaction ID
  amount: number; 
  status: PaymentStatus;
  statusMessage: string; // Payment status message coming from bank
  date: Date;
}
```

Make sure your server is configured to handle the incoming webhook requests and process the payment data accordingly.
