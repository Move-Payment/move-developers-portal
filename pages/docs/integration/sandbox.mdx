title: "Using the Sandbox Environment"
---

The MovePay sandbox environment allows you to safely test your integration before going live. This guide explains how to access the sandbox dashboard and configure your API requests.

## Merchant Dashboard

To access the merchant dashboard in the sandbox environment, use the following URL:

[https://merchant.sandbox.movepay.de/](https://merchant.sandbox.movepay.de/)

Create a sandbox account. The sandbox dashboard provides access to all features available in the production environment, allowing you to simulate transactions and test your integration.

## API Base URL

When making API requests in the sandbox environment, set your base URL to:

`https://api.sandbox.movepay.de/`

All API endpoints are available under this base URL. Make sure your API client is configured to use this URL during development and testing.

## Fake bank payments

You can simulate payments using the sandbox's built-in fake bank.
For example, if you want to test OAuth-based payments, you can use the following bank: Fake OAuth Bank with Client Keys

 No real funds are transferred.

## Notes

- The sandbox environment is isolated from production. No real transactions or funds are processed.
- When you are ready to go live, switch your dashboard and API URLs to the production endpoints.
